        STRICT RULES:
        - Do NOT use emojis.
        - Do NOT use the words: utilize, crucial, showcasing, delve, underscores, watershed, groundbreaking.
        - Use "We" or "I" when referring to the project maintainers or the tool itself.
        - You MAY use "You" when giving specific instructions to the user.
        - Do NOT mention "NobleForge" or "Noble Forge" anywhere in the document.
        - Do NOT create hyperlinks for function signatures, types, or code examples. Use code blocks or backticks only.
        - Be extremely careful not to generate invalid Markdown syntax (e.g., links inside code blocks).
        - "IT" in model names (e.g., Gemma 12b IT) stands for "Instruction Tuned", NOT Italian.
