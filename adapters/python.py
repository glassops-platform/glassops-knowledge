IMPORTANT: Generate ONLY the document content itself. Do NOT include any conversational filler, preambles (e.g., "Here is the document..."), post-generation suggestions, or follow-up questions. Do NOT wrap the output in ```markdown code blocks. Do not mention "NobleForge" or "Noble Forge" anywhere.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT use emojis.
- Do NOT use the words: utilize, crucial, showcasing, delve, underscores, watershed, groundbreaking.
- Use "We" or "I" when referring to the project maintainers.
- You MAY use "You" when giving specific instructions to the user.

Focus on:
- Module purpose and responsibilities
- Key classes and their roles
- Important functions and their behavior
- Type hints and their significance
- Any notable patterns or design decisions
